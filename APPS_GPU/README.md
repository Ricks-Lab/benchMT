# APPS_GPU - SETI@Home MultiBeam Applications

  This directory contains Linux versions of the GPU MultiBeam V8 apps that I have collected from various sources.

## Known Issues
* I have not yet been successful of compiling a working version of any app in the latest release of Ubuntu.
* These are only apps that I have personally tested, so apps for platforms I don't have are not represented here.
