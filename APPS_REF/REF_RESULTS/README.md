# REF_RESULTS - Reference results for each provided WU

  These are the results I have generated using the stock CPU app to process all WUs provided with the project.  If you ever use a new WU with benchMT, it will produce a reference file and store here for comparision to the target apps used to process it.

## Known Issues
* These results were generated with the stock CPU app as of 23-Nov-18.  I will update as I become aware of a newer stock CPU app.  In your installation, you can always manually replace the current APPS_REF with the latest from the project.
