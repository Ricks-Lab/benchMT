# APPS_REF - SETI@Home MultiBeam Applications - Stock Reference App

  This directory contains Linux versions of the current stock CPU MultiBeam V8 app.  It is recommended to use this app to generate reference results to assure you are verifying integrity against a known standard.

## Known Issues
* This was the stock app as of 23-Nov-18.  I will update as I become aware of a newer stock CPU app.
