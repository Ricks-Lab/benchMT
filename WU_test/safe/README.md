# WU_test Reference Work Units

  This directory contains 15 reference Work Units for which there are reference results already provided
  in the *APPS_REF/REF_RESULTS* directory.  These WUs are meant to represent typical workload and should also
  represent potential WU characteristics including Angle Range and signals.  This list up WUs should be
  updated periodically.  I suggest SETI@Home message boards for discussion on updating the list of reference
  Work Units.

## Known Issues
* Some of the WUs are old and may not represent current distribution of work.
