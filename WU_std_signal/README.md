# WU_std_signals - Standard Signal Work Units

  This directory contains 4 standard signal Work Units for which there are reference results already provided
  in the *APPS_REF/REF_RESULTS* directory.  These WUs are for testing functionality and do not represent the 
  complexity and variability of real Work Units.  Their processing time is approximately 10x faster than a
  real work units and are meant for testing only.

## Known Issues
* None of these WUs contain a Gaussian type signal.
